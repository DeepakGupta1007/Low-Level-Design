Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its 
implementation so that the two can vary independently.

// Use Case -
Let's take an example of LivingThings,NonLivingThings i.e. Dog,Tree
Fish and define a method breathingProcess for each of them.

Now, let's say want to introduce new breathing process we need to create 
an extra class for that. due to tightly coupling.


Solution - Separate BreathProcess from these classes.
