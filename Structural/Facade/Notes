Use Cases -

Whenever we have to hide the system complexity.

Example - Car Accelerator,Brake
Example - We can process an order , getProduct,MakePayment,GenerateInvoice,SendNotification

If done individually , change in the order process will be in the client so we can include this all inside facade.

Proxy is for the same interface where as Facade is not.

Adapter makes the client and orginal interface compatible.
